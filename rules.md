<p> DevDay is a free event where the goal is to bring together people who work with technology. From a student, someone who has an interest in technology, to an expert.
Our goal is to make even an expert access to basic content of something you do not know.
With the event, we aim to get companies in the city to connect with people and to connect people to each other, creating future meetings for interaction.</p>
