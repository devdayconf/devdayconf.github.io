<p> DevDay is a free event where the goal is to bring together people who work with technology. From a student, someone who has an interest in technology, to an expert.</p>
<p>
Our goal is to make even an expert access to basic content of something you do not know.</p>
<p>
With the event, we aim to get companies in the city to connect with people and to connect people to each other, creating future meetings for interaction.</p>
