<p> <strong>+Con</strong> is a free event where the goal is to bring together developers, design, managers, students and anyone who is curious about technology. From a student, or someone who has an interest in technology, to a specialist.</p>
<p>
Our goal is to make even an expert access to basic content of something you do not know.</p>
<p>
With the event, we aim to get companies in the city to connect with people and to connect people to each other, creating future meetings for interaction.</p>
